# Exercise: (Dense) Matrix-Matrix Multiplication

In this exercise you will consider dense matrix-matrix multiplication

$C_{rc} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{rk} B_{kc}$

for square matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$ of size $n \times n$. Despite being seemingly simple, you will see that different implementations have vastly different performance.
